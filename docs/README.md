# Map of trusted providers for my AppSec training and technical watch

> 👨‍🎓 For SANS training, I only trust specified instructors.

> 💡 Additional online tool to create a mindmap from markdown code: https://markdown-map.com/

👨‍🎓I leverage:
* **AppSecEngineer** to learn new concepts related to AppSec regarding thread modeling, cloud, containers and Kubernetes domains.
* **PentesterLab** to learn:
  * New and existing classes of web-based vulnerabilities as well as how to prevent/fix them.
  * How to perform effective secure code review against differents langages.
* **Portswigger** to learn new concepts related to AppSec regarding web domains. This include also learning of using Burp at the most effective way.
